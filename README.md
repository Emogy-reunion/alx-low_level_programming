#C PROGRAMMING 
* This project is aimed to cover everything you need to know about C programming language.

* C programming language is a high level programming language - it enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of       computer.
* It is a general purpose language since:
- used to write programs in many different domains such as operating systems, numerical computing and graphical applications
- Has high level programming constructs such as statement grouping, decision making and loopings.
- Has low level capabilities such as the ability to manipulate bytes and addresses.
* It has the following features:
1. procedural language - instructions in a C program are executed step by step.
2. portable - C programs from one platform can be movved to another and run without complications.
3. speed - It is faster than other languages like javaand python since it is a compiled language.
4. General purpose - Can be used to develop operating systems, embedded systems, databases and so on.
* It is important to learn Cprogramming because:
1. C helps you learn the internal architecture of a computer - how the computer stores and retrieves information.
2. After learning C it is much easier to learn other programming languages like java and python
3. Opportunity to work on open source projects - some of the largest open source projjects like the Linux kernel, python interpreter , SQlite database are 
	 written in c

* The advantages of learning C programming languages are:
1. C supports structured programming design 
- it allows you to break down programs into functions.
- it also allows the use of comments, making programs readable and easily maintainable.
2. Efficiency
- C is a concise language
- it allows you to say what you mean in a few words so the final code tends to be more compact and runs quickly.
3. Portability
- C programs written for one system can runn with little or no modification on other systems.
4. Power and flexibility
- power - C has been used to write operating systems, language compilers, assemblers ,text editors, language interpreters and appliucation packages.
- Flexibility - it has been used to solve problems in areas such as physics and engineering.
5. Programmer orientation
- C is programmer oriented since it:
* Gives access to the hardware.
* It lets you manipulate individual bits of memory.
* It also has a rich selection operators that allow you to expand programming capabilities.

#TECHNOLOGIES USED
* C programming language.
* Compiled using GCC 9.4.0
* Tested on UBUNTU 20.04.5

#DIRECTORIES
* The directories in this repository contain files with either scripts,programs or functions that perform various tasks.
* This repository contains the following directories:
