##C POINTERS,ARRAYS,AND STRINGS.
Project aimed at learning the working of pointers, arrays and strings in C programming language.

##Technologies
* Functions written using C programming language
* Tested on UBUNTU 20.04
* Compiled using GCC 9.4.0 compiler

##Files
Each of the files below contains a function that:
